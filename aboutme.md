My name is Michael Toce. I have a B.S. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from Villanova University and minored in Peace & Justice. I love a lot of things, the world is a pretty amazing place, however games, fitness, science, and math are among my greatest. I'm a triathlete who has completed a Half Ironman and am training for my second. I also I enjoy being around others and love collaborating.
